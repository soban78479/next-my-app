                <h1>How do I pack the items I have SOLD?</h1>

                <br /><br />

                <p>
                    This process is very easy! We suggest using standard Nike or Adidas
                    boxes (29x19x16 or 30x20x15 inches), and pack 12 or 13 prs per box. If you unfold
                    boxes properly you may be able to fit an extra pair or two! Check out this video
                    we found (we are not in that video or know anyone in this video) it is a tutorial for
                    sellers who do not know how to flatten shoe boxes. With this method you can pack
                    14 to 15 pairs versus 12 pairs per box:
                </p>

                </AspectRatio>


<p>
Do not put more than 15 pairs of shoes per box and do not fold/flatten shoe boxes, 
that are not foldable! For example, certain pair of shoes like Jordan 
retro boxes do not fold and certain adidas consortium do not fold as well so please be very careful!
